This problem is similar to onesAndZeros but this time, 
you will choose three consecutive elements of the same value and remove them from the string to obtain a new string of length n-3. 
Given a string s ,after applying the described operation several times, what is the minimum length of the string that can remain ?

Example

For s = "1000", the output should be onesAndZeros(s) = 1.
By removing three consecutive zeros, we will have string s with minimum length equal to 1.
Input/Output

[execution time limit] 0.5 second

[input] string s

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ s.length ≤ 10^5.

[output] int
The minimum length of the string that may remain after applying the described operations several times.
